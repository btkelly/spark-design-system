# Accessibility Guidelines

- For Web accessibility, adhere to [WCAG 2.1 (Level AA) standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
- For Mobile accessibility, adhere to [W3C/WAI Mobile Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/).
- For Multimedia accessibility, adhere to [Multimedia Accessibility W3C Policy](https://www.w3.org/2008/06/video-notes).
- For Authoring Tools Accessibility (such as Software, Content Management Systems (CMS), Courseware Tools, Content Aggregators), follow [ATAG Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/).
- For browsers, media players, and other “User Agent” Accessibility, follow [UAAG Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/).

### Four Principles of Accessibility

##### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must
be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
(e.g., alt tags that say what the item actually
does, like ‘Submit form Button’).

##### Operable

User interface components and navigation must
be operable (e.g., you must be able to navigate
the site using a keyboard as well as a mouse).

##### Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface
must be understandable, (e.g., error messaging
on a form should make sense; instead of ‘Invalid
field’ messaging, use ‘The Email field must be
in a valid format’).

##### Robust

Content must be robust enough so it can be
interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user
agents, including assistive technologies. In
other words, don’t use tags or code that only
certain browsers understand.

### Guidelines Checklist

- ##### Text Alternatives

    Provide alternatives for non-text content
    (e.g., images) so that the content is
    accessible for all users.

- ##### Time-Based Media

    Provide an alternative (e.g., transcript)
    for time-based media (e.g., audio/video) that
    presents equivalent information, or link to
    textual information with comparable information
    for non-prerecorded media).

- ##### Adaptable

    Create content that can be presented in different
    ways without losing information or structure.

- ##### Distinguishable

    Make it easy for users to see and hear content,
    including separating foreground and background,
    by using readable fonts, larger font sizes, and
    highlighted link styling for example.

- ##### Keyboard Accessible

    Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

- ##### Timing

    Provide enough time for users to read and use content.

- ##### Seizures

    Do not include design elements that are known to
    cause seizures (e.g., rapid flashing).

- ##### Navigable

    Provide multiple ways to allow users to navigate
    content including obvious/prominent links and
    other techniques.

- ##### Readable

    Make text content readable and understandable via styling and other
    techniques. Consider the accessibility best practices of certain text
    symbols before using them in text content. For example, avoid ampersands
    in order to prevent conflict with screen readers.

- ##### Predictable

    Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

- ##### Input Assistance

    Assist users with web experience, correct mistakes
    and describe errors in text.

- ##### Compatible

    Maximize compatibility with current and future
    user agents, including assistive technologies.
