# Validation Messaging Guide

## Main Takeaways
Giving validation feedback is an emotional process. Support users with this process by following these guidelines:

- Explain what the Input expects before the user enters data. (Example: password rules, ranges, etc)
- Give clear and helpful feedback when encountering a problem.
- Use a combination of [placement](#placement), [timing](#timing), and [language](#language) to guide users through moments of uncertainty.

## Placement
- Place messaging close to the input. Spark places validation directly under the input.
- Provide a clear visual to indicate something has gone wrong with user input and needs attention.
- Plan error messaging for every field.
- On Forms with multiple fields, show validation messaging for each input field to guide users to a successful submission.

## Timing
-	Show validation messaging after the user enters the data or when the input becomes out of **selection focus**.
- On forms, show error messaging **before** the user submits the form.

> **Selection focus** changes when a user taps or clicks anywhere outside of the current focused input. Focus can also change
> through keyboard navigation.

## Language
<ul>
  <li>
    Use labels and helper text to clarify what data the input expects. Messaging should be related and relevant to the Input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deliver direct and concise statement of the problem in non-technical terms. Write out abbreviations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use sentence case. Do not use all caps.
  </li>
  <li>
    Direct users to the next action to solve the problem.
    <ul class="sprk-b-List sprk-b-List--indented sprk-u-Measure sprk-u-mvs">
      <li>
        Use positive action verbs, rather than negative ones. Focus on the solution by explaining what to do, opposed to what not to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the “error” is a system condition that blocks the user from accomplishing a task, offer them a way to be notified of updated system status.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow accessibility guidelines, and where applicable, ARIA-live attributes.
  </li>
</ul>


## Examples
Use error messaging to clarify any system errors and additional constraints to the user.
- *Choose a T-shirt size.* (Example: Radio Input, Dropdown)
- *Choose at least one of the options.* (Example: Checkbox)
- *Enter your first name.* (Example: Text Input)
- *Enter an amount that is less than your current balance of $19,800.* (Example: Monetary Input)
- *Enter a date within the past 99 years.* (Example: data input constraint)
- *Enter your 9-digit Social Security Number.*
- *Create a password that meets the following criteria:*
  - *It has at least 8 characters*
  - *Contains a number.*
  - *Contains a special character.*
